=head1 DESCRIPTION

Location object. It's a very simple match to the marker_location table in the database, but it has a little bit of intelligence too.

=head2 new

    my $location=CXGN::Marker::Location->new($dbh,$location_id);

Takes a dbh and a location_id and returns an object representing little more than a row in the marker_location table.

    my $location=CXGN::Marker::Location->new($dbh);

Takes a dbh and returns an empty object which can perform an insert into the marker_location table.
