=head2 new

Create a new marker to be stored.

    my $existing_marker_to_add_data=CXGN::Marker::Modifiable->new($dbh,$marker_id);

Get an existing marker but add new data to it.

=head2 set_marker_name

    $marker->set_marker_name('c2-blah/?_333');

Sets the markers preferred name. If you want to add another alias for this marker, youll need to do it in the database, since its a rare occurrence. There may be a server-side database function we have written to do it. 

=cut

    }
    $self->{marker_names}->[0]=$clean_name;
}

=head2 set_marker_name_noclean

    $marker->set_marker_name_noclean('anymarkername');

Sets the markers preferred name without doing the smart clean. Caution, markers will be entered exactly as typed and this may lead to near duplicates in the database.

sub set_marker_name_noclean
{
    my $self=shift;
    my($name)=@_;

=head2 add_collection

    $marker->add_collection('COSII');

Add a collection name (not collection ID) to a markers attributes. A marker can be part of any number of collections, but usually that number is only 1 or 2.

=head2 add_source

    $marker->add_source({source_name=>'EST BY READ',id_in_source=>3});

This is how we say that a marker comes from an EST, for instance. A marker could have any number of sources, but usually that number is only 1 or 2. You must send in a hashref with the appropriate values.

    }
    push(@{$self->{derived_from_sources}},$source_hash);
}

=head2 add_experiment

Add an entry for the marker_experiment table, to be stored by this object later, when store_new_data is called.
Protocol should be specified when sending in a location on its own. When sending in an experiment object with
the location, the experiment object will be expected to contain the protocol, so in that case, do not send it in.

Add a map location with no related experiment data:

    $marker->add_experiment({location=>$location_object,protocol=>'RFLP'});

Add a map location which was discovered by way of a PCR experiment:

    $marker->add_experiment({location=>$location_object,pcr_experiment=>$pcr_experiment_object});

Add a map location which was discovered by way of an RFLP experiment:

    $marker->add_experiment({location=>$location_object,rflp_experiment=>$rflp_experiment_object});

=head2 store_new_data

    $marker->store_new_data();

Store all data for this marker which does not already exist in the database. 
This is unlike the more simple 'store_unless_exists' function which I have written for other objects, such as CXGN::Marker::Location.
This method will not make an all-or-nothing decision as to whether to 'store' this marker.
Instead, it will explore all of this markers data and only store the parts of it that are not already stored.
If you somehow manage to put this marker object into a state in which it has LESS data than the corresponding tables in the database, you are evil.
However, it will still try to insert any new data it contains.

Rather than calling store_new_data, which only handles new inserts, not updates, the CAPS loading script
must call this function instead. This function will take a newly created (and stored) experiment object
and connect it to an existing location which was loaded earlier by the map data loading script.
